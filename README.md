# mf-mushroom-factory

Requirements

You are going to modify your Mushroom Mania application to use a factory to retrieve the mushroom data instead of retrieving it directly in your controller.

Create a new factory for your Angular application. Make sure your factory returns something.
Inject the factory dependency into your controller.
Invoke the appropriate function that your factory exposes to get the mushroom data.
When the method is successful, take the results and put them into $scope.mushrooms variable in your controller that is bound to the partial.
